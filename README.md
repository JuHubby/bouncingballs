# Bouncing Figures Animation: Playful Motion in Action

## Description:

For this excersice I  use JavaScript language. This is a dynamic and engaging animation that brings life to bouncing figures (e.g., circles, squares) within a confined boundary. These figures continuously bounce off the edges, adding a dynamic element to the animation. he code is easily customizable, developers  could change parametres such as the shapes of the bouncing figures, their size, boundary size, color and order of overlapping.

## Features:

**Boundary Constraints:** The figures are confined within a defined boundary to prevent them from moving outside the visible canvas area. When a figure reaches the edge, it smoothly changes direction and continues bouncing within the boundary.

**Overlapping Figures:** To add depth and visual interest, the code provides the ability to create figures with varying z-index values. This allows figures to overlap and gives the animation a layered and immersive look.

**Customization:** The code is easily customizable, enabling developers to adjust parameters like figure size, color, boundary size, and more, to suit their specific project requirements.

## Usage:

This code creates a visually captivating and endless loop of bouncing figures that can be used for both entertainment, comercial, and educational purposes. for example:

 - Homepage Animation
 - Loading Screen
 - Product Showcases
 - Interactive Banners
 - Background Animation
 - Interactive Tutorials

## Roadmap:

I am planning some improvements for this project, such as the creation of multiple figures (e.g., triangles) and updating shape variability. This update will allow users to customize the shapes of the bouncing figures, enabling them to switch between different shapes and colors, creating an ever-changing visual experience. Additionally, I plan to add a translucent effect whenever the figures overlap. Lastly, I will definitely create interactive control for the animation, which can be controlled by buttons for functions like starting, pausing, and adjusting the animation speed.
